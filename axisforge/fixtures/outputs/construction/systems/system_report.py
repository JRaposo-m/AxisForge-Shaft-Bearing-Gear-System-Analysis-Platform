fixtures/outputs/construction/systems/system_report.py

Report blocks for the `systems` Construction domain -- mirrors
fixtures/construction/systems/ one-to-one, same reasoning as
shaft_report.py.

Four functions, each "the systems report" for one facet of a
SpurHelicalGearSystem:

  topology_block(system)   -- delegates to SpurHelicalGearSystem.summary()
                              (core already formats topology + resolved
                              state -- source shaft, link count, and,
                              once resolved, per-shaft T_out/rotation_dir/
                              shaft_position).
  shaft_system_block(ss)   -- delegates to ShaftSystem.summary() (core
                              already formats length/speed/design life/
                              axis offset/bearing-gear-load counts).
  loads_block(ss)          -- ShaftSystem.loads has no dedicated core
                              summary(); this lists every Load
                              position-sorted, tagged with its own
                              source ("user"/"gear_mesh"/
                              "bearing_reaction") so a caller-declared
                              load (ShaftSpec.loads) is never confused
                              with one resolve() injected.
  mesh_block(link)         -- link-level info (shaft_a -> shaft_b,
                              phi_deg, torque_split, distribute_loads,
                              label) plus SpurHelicalMeshLink.meshing's
                              own .summary() (SpurHelicalGearMeshing,
                              core).

topology_block and shaft_system_block are thin wrappers, same reasoning
as bearing_report.bearing_block(): core already covers them well, kept
here anyway so systems has the same one-call-per-domain shape as
shafts/bearings/gears.

CONTENT ONLY -- this module builds text blocks, it does not write any
file. fixtures/outputs/construction/text_report.py is the single place
that assembles every domain's blocks (this module's plus
shafts/bearings/gears') into the one combined construction report .txt
and actually writes it. See that module's own docstring for the full
reasoning.
